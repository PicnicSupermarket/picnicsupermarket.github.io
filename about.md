## Set up instructions

Fork this Jekyll-Grid on Github: [https://github.com/femmebot/jekyll-grid](https://github.com/femmebot/jekyll-grid)

Part of the [25x52](http://25x52.com) initiative, this theme is based on [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). Refer to the following original instructions for help with the setup:

> Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below :point_down:).

> ![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

> The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
